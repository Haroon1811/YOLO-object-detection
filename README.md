We use YOLO(You Only Look Once) V5 architecture for object detection , tracking and counting. 
This code is using OpenCV's deep neural network (DNN) module to load and configure a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model from a pre-trained ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) file.
The dataset was created custom by downloading pictures from flickr and then annotating using LabelImg annotator application.
